This is an important topic in stack manipulation.
What we used to believe
    - The last element pushed using s.push(T ele) should be on top of the stack and s.pop() returns that element.

Actual (As made evident in StackWithMin.java and StackWithMax.java)
    - You can call s.push(T ele) and put some altogether different element on top of the stack as long as you can
    return the same ele by calling s.pop()

The above is on the lines of array modulo,multiplication trick that we have been using to store two elements.

In the case of StackWithMin, we pushed using minEle and the ele with certain conditions.
Similarly we popped using same conditions.

Ideally, if you can figure out the condition and equation while pushing you can use the same while popping.
